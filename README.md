# Project 1 for Client Side Web Development
This branch of the Repo is for the first of two projects, that I have to do while on my ERASMUS-Semester in Ireland  
The goal is to recreate the game __Rock Paper Scissors__ , and for me personally, get more comfortable in using the technologies used.
Speaking off..

## Technologies
I'm using basically the same stuff I had to use during my lectures in Germany to get bettter at them.  
These are: __Vite, React, TS, react-hook-form, React-Router, BootstrapReact, VSCode, npm, GIT__

## Goals
The goal is of course perfectly fine code that has zero errors and does everything as I imagine it.  
Since that is impossible I want it working just fine enough so it's playable.  
Much more important to me is the "Behind the scenes". What I mean by that is regular commits, ordered file structures, clean code, CI/CD, ...  
So how the code was/is created. In a way the path is more important than the actual goal.

Feel free to use this code here as you want, once finished this is hopefully a working client-side-only webpage to play RPS
